# **BinChillin**:
BINCHILLIN is a next generation smart IOT bin. The bin can add an interactive element and gamify throwing of the trash. While inspiring people to clean up after themselves, it utilizes light to add colours to create inviting and relaxing spaces for the user. The bin encompasses the concept that something mundane and often overlooked like the rubbish bin can be transformed into something that is beautiful for the user using design thinking and analysis.

# **Context**:
BinChillin was created as part of SUTD's 03.007 project. The project required us to do a detailed analysis of a site and think of ways to improve the area.

For our group, we analysed the site and realised that it is

The game consists of moving platforms and a ball idling on the top. The user will have to time their throw of the trash such that the ball drops to the bottom without touching any of the walls. The user will receive a reward from the machine if their ball successfully reach the bottom.

# **Finite State Machine**

FSM concept was used to represent the states of the game for logic control.


# **Bit operations**
To improve the refresh rate for the game, bit control was used to represent the game state so that it does not take up majority of the CPU access.

# **Prototype testing**
For the testing of our prototype, we conducted both virtual and physical testing.
